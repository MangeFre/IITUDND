# Identifying Informative Twitter Users During Natural Disasters

Note: project under development!

Highlights:

● Seeking to improve accuracy and AUC on CrisisMMD multimodal human-labeled dataset

● Reframing the problem as predicting informative tweets in a sequence of posts by a user

● Incorporating unlabeled data from Twitter API to augment user tweet histories

● Extracting tf-idf and GloVe language features and ResNet image features

● LSTM and baseline MLP neural networks in PyTorch
